<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

<!-- I am currently a Physics Ph.D. candidate at [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/) and [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Ravelosona dafiné](https://www.spin-ion.com/about-us/), the director of research [CNRS](https://www.cnrs.fr/fr) and CTO of [Spin-Ion Technologies](https://www.spin-ion.com/). -->

I am an undergraduate student at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Hao Zhang](https://optics.fudan.edu.cn/2a/11/c39771a469521/page.htm).
Currently, I work with the Computational Design and Fabrication Group [(CDFG)](https://cdfg.csail.mit.edu) at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), under the supervision of Prof. [Wojciech Matusik.](https://cdfg.csail.mit.edu/wojciech)
During the summer of 2025, I was a visiting student at Stanford University, where I deepened my knowledge in machine learning and computational modeling.

## Research Interest
- **AI for Science:** Integrating artificial intelligence with physics and materials science to enable autonomous scientific discovery.  
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Scientific reasoning, domain-specific fine-tuning, and multi-agent collaboration for theorem generation and experimental design.  
- **Axiom-based Reasoning Systems:** Developing the *AutoAxiom* and *AxiomEngine* frameworks to formalize, verify, and simulate machine-generated scientific principles.  
- **Crystal Graph Neural Networks:** High-precision structure–property mapping, multi-domain bandgap prediction, and universal atomic embeddings (ct-UAE).  
- **Material Informatics:** Dataset curation, data cleaning automation, and synthesis pathway prediction for perovskite and thermoelectric materials.  
- **Physics-driven Simulation:** Closed-loop validation of AI hypotheses through numerical solvers, queueing dynamics, and physical PDE systems.  
- **Human–AI Co-evolution:** Exploring frameworks where AI agents learn, refine, and evolve knowledge analogously to human scientific progress.
